## Introduction
Vagrant Logistics ("we", "us", or "our") operates this freighting platform. We are committed to protecting the privacy of your EVE Online character data.

## Data We Collect
We collect the following information via EVE Online Single Sign-On (SSO) and ESI:
*   **Character ID and Name:** To identify you as a user.
*   **Corporation and Alliance Membership:** To verify access to alliance-specific services.
*   **Contract Data:** Details of courier contracts submitted to VGLGI (Item lists, routes, rewards).
*   **Access Tokens:** Encrypted tokens to verify your character's identity. We do not store Refresh Tokens for standard users.

## How We Use Your Data
1.  **Authentication:** To log you in and maintain your session.
2.  **Service Provision:** To calculate quotes, track freight, and manage contract disputes.
3.  **Audit Logs:** We maintain logs of all contract actions (submission, acceptance, delivery) for dispute resolution.

## Data Sharing
*   **Discord:** Contract summaries (Character Name, Route, Volume) are sent to our private Discord server for hauler notifications.
*   **Third Parties:** We do not sell or share your data with external advertisers or other third parties, except as required by CCP Games or law enforcement.

## Data Retention
*   **Active Contracts:** Kept until completion or rejection.
*   **History:** Historical contract data is retained for statistical analysis and dispute resolution for up to 2 years.
*   **Session Data:** Stored in secure cookies and server-side session stores, expiring after inactivity.

## Your Rights
You may request the deletion of your personal data (Character mapping and history) by contacting a VGLGI Director in-game. Note that public EVE Online data (e.g., contract history visible in-game) is outside our control.

## Cookies
We use essential cookies to maintain your login session. We do not use tracking or advertising cookies.
